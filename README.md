# 😊 Face Emotion Detection using MATLAB

A real-time facial emotion recognition system built using **MATLAB** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. This project detects emotions such as 😄 Happy, 😢 Sad, and 😠 Angry using live webcam input and classifies them using a trained deep learning model.
